EcoAdvisor AI 🌍🌱

Reimagining Conservation with AI

EcoAdvisor AI is an experimental project exploring how AI-powered tools can support sustainable farming, soil regeneration, ecosystem restoration, and urban greening—tailored to hyperlocal geography.

The goal: bridge the gap between broad climate data and actionable, location-specific guidance for farmers, city planners, park managers, and conservationists.

✨ Core Idea

Conservation efforts often fall short due to ineffective interventions or lack of local context. EcoAdvisor AI aims to change that by combining:

Generative AI for natural interaction – farmers, scientists, or city officials can ask questions in plain language and receive contextual guidance.

Data integration – pulling from satellite imagery, soil maps, biodiversity inventories, and climate data.

Predictive modeling – simulating ecosystem outcomes before real-world deployment.
